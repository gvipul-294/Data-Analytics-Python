      Initially I converted the Excel file into five csv files for each sheet in excel file.
      Then, I wrote a code in Python using Pandas for extracting answer keys and marks for each question in the test 1 
      and inserting in a dataframe.
      
      Then I used the responses of each student from the third sheet, compared the marks with the answer key 
      and assigned the marks in case of correct attempt
